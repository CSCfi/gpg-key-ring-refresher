	Implemented functionality to set limits on the number of
	signatures keys may have so as to mitigate signature flooding
	attacks. The documentation is updated accordingly. Kudos to
	Kristoffer Sederl√∂f for alerting on this type of attacks.
	Less kudos to him because this required a major redesign of the
	script and a fair amount of debugging :-).

	Version 0.1.0.

	Added docs/Tips.md and made minor improvements to the rest
	of the documentation. Version 0.0.6.

	Fourth release & fifth release. Improved wordings in
	documentation, added the output of "gpg-key-ring-refresher -h" as
	a separate section to docs/Overview.md. Upped the version number
	accordingly.

	Third release. More markdownification. Markdown should be a standard
	but apparently, everybody's implemented their own extensions to it.
