2024-02-09  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Added aux scripts directory-rotator and copy-and-rotate-dir-if-changes-found
	to safely rotate the production PGP key ring being automatically refreshed.
	These can be used in the absense of a full-fledged backup solution.

	Updated the documentation accordingly.

	Version 0.1.4

2024-01-12  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Added some new log messages, improved some log messages, fixed some
	inconsistencies in existing log messages when it comes to the choice of
	INFO or WARN level messages.

	Changed the way the auxiliary executables are found, this to compensate
	the more limited PATH cron usually offers to the tasks it runs.

	Dropped pgp.key-server.io from the preconfigured PGP key servers.

	README.md and docs/*.md retouched.

	Version 0.1.3

2020-12-08  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Improvements to logger output, both INFO and DEBUG levels.
	Made logged exit status reflect keys not found and keys exceeding
	signature limits in unattended runs of the script.

	Version 0.1.2

2020-12-03  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Small fixes to documentation.

2020-12-01  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Implemented functionality to set limits on the number of
	signatures keys may have so as to mitigate signature flooding
	attacks. The documentation is updated accordingly. Kudos to
	Kristoffer Sederl√∂f for alerting on this type of attacks.
	Less kudos to him because this required a major redesign of the
	script and a fair amount of debugging :-).

	Version 0.1.0.

2020-10-16  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Added docs/Tips.md and made minor improvements to the rest
	of the documentation. Version 0.0.6.

2020-10-09  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Fourth release & fifth release. Improved wordings in
	documentation, added the output of "gpg-key-ring-refresher -h" as
	a separate section to docs/Overview.md. Upped the version number
	accordingly.

2020-10-08  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Third release. More markdownification. Markdown should be a standard
	but apparently, everybody's implemented their own extensions to it.

2020-10-08  Mika Silander <mika.silander@csc.fi>

	Second release. Markdownified the documentation.

	First release.
